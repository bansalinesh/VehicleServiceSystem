## Introduction

This project is a simple web application for a vehicle repair/service shop or business. The application provides an online platform for clients or potential clients of the shop to submit their service requests. The primary goal of this project is to streamline the process of managing service requests and reduce the time consumed by both the management and clients.

The application aims to centralize information about the services offered by the service center, available service centers, and transaction details. By automating the existing manual system, the project intends to ensure long-term storage of valuable data, easy accessibility, and manipulation of the stored information.

## Background

The project was initiated due to the challenges faced by customers in booking car-related services. Often, customers do not receive comprehensive details about services and schedules, leading to disorganized vehicle collections near service facilities. The project aims to address this issue by introducing consistency and transparency in the services provided.

The manual guidelines in the previous system led to unorganized tasks for repairs, and a lack of adequate staff to handle a large number of customers simultaneously. The proposed Vehicles Service Centre Management System incorporates Priority Scheduling to enhance work management. The system's database stores all necessary data, allowing for efficient data retrieval, quicker document preparation, and improved management information support.

## Objectives

1. Maximize efficiency, productivity, and safety of vehicles and drivers.
2. Assist in vehicle tracking, reporting on fuel consumption, monitoring driver behavior, and managing vehicle maintenance.
3. Manage all transactions related to vehicle profiling, vehicle bookings, booking details, daily expenses, daily reports, and customer feedback.

## Methodology

The project follows the Structured Analysis and Design Methodology (SADM) using the waterfall model. The development phases include planning, requirement analysis, design, implementation, testing, and operation/maintenance. Each phase aims to meet the specified requirements, and the project is subject to maintenance after completion.

## Observations and Findings

The project implementation allowed users to register their vehicles and specify required services based on the vehicle type. Notable features of the Vehicle Management System include:

### Service Request Form
- Customers can provide vehicle details.
- Customers can request specific services.
- Customers can submit basic information.

## Limitations

1. No Pick-up and Drop Service: Currently, pick-up and delivery services are not offered. Future plans involve implementing this service.
2. Limited User Base: During the testing phase, a beta version is released to manage backend workload and ensure a functional UI.
3. Service Availability: The current functionality is limited to Patiala due to research and development constraints in other cities.

## Conclusion

The Vehicle Management System project has the potential to expand to various cities and towns in India. Future collaboration with like-minded engineers could facilitate database management and application handling.
